# Hackerrank-Automation

Hello everyone! ,I have Written a Automation script using #Node.js . In which a HackerRank Question gets solved by pasting code from a answers filled file into the text editor and submit button gets clicked and Boom ,all test-cases gets passed .

The aim of the Hackerrank Automation project was to make a script that can be used to fill some selected questions by the recommended solutions in a instant and avoid manual copy-paste , and one would trust the solutions as they passed all the test cases and got a all correct(AC).

The only NPM library I used in this project is :
->Puppeteer : puppeteer is a node library that provides a high level API to control headless chrome over the dev tools protocol.
=>And I learned a lot about Promises while making this project
